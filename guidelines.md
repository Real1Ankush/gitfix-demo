# Important Principles

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness:** Write code that is easy to read, not just code that works.
2. **Modern Standards:** Always use `const` or `let`. Avoid `var`.
3. **Meaningful Comments:** Explain *why* a complex decision was made, not *what* the syntax does.
4. **Descriptive Naming:** Variable names should explain their purpose (e.g., `isUserLoggedIn` instead of `x`).
5. **Tone:** Be helpful, constructive, and direct.
